NJRestaurants
=============
This was an application built to help test our knowledge on SQL and tested our skills of integrating what we had learned into a real application. We used JSP, HTML, and CSS for the front-end. We utilized an H2 driver to help store and retrieve data within our H2 database. Most of the data was randomly generated using scripts that we had built using java. The application was run on an apache tomcat application server. We made use of JDBC in order to communicate with the database's tables and my team ended up being 1 of 6 finalists for this assignment in a class of 80+ students.
