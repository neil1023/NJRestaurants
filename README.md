NJRestaurants
=============
This was an application built to help test our knowledge on SQL and its integration into real applications. We used JSP, HTML, and CSS for the front-end. We utilized an H2 driver to help store and retrieve within our H2 database. Most of the data was randomly generated using scripts that we had built.
